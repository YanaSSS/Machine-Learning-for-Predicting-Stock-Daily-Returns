# Predicting-Daily-Stock-Returns-with-Different-Machine-Learning-Models
My first Machine Learning project

I will timely update my progress

## I use Jupyter notebook as a tool for the project
## Language - Python
### Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (for the ML algorithms)

Process:
1. Start with reading the data. You can check out the file (Code for downloading stock prices data.ipynb) in this repository where I have the code for extracting the data from Yahoo to csv.
2. Data cleaning - I will need to check my data for some problems before I proceed with the main task in the project - check for null values. Check for missing values. Check for values type and so on.
3. Visualizing data

to be continued... :)
